## Common Themes
Common themes observed within these papers was that they used part of a reputable external source, such as a journal article or government-released report to substantiate their claims. More than this, they usually hand-pick figures or text that support their position, while disregarding other scientific articles in opposition. In addition, many of the articles used a slippery slope argument. For example, Article 2 correctly described data suggesting that there may not be as large a correlation between Arctic ice melting and mid-latitudes, but further went on to say that this disproves the polar vortex theory altogether. Another common approach is to begin with direct insults towards climate scientists who are contradicting the author, without proving why they are wrong in the first place.

## Evaluation of #1 Claim
I have chosen to evaluate the article titled “Canada is Warming at Only 1/2 the Rate of Climate Model Simulations (Roy, 2021). This article begins by describing that it wanted to compare the warming observed in Canada to the warming predicted by climate models. From the 30-year period of 1991-2020, the author took the average of 108 model simulations (calibrated to the geographical region of Canada), and compared this to the observed temperatures over the same period. From the results (see Figure 1), the author concluded that Canada has only been warming at +0.23ºC/decade, as compared to the model average of +0.49ºC. In addition, he found that 93.5% of model simulations predicted warmer temperatures than the observed temperatures. Finally, stating that since CO2 was not heavily released until the 1970s and anthropogenic SO2 offset carbon emissions in the mid-20th century, the author suggested that only measuring temperature trends from the 1980s would provide a satisfactory measure of anthropogenic warming. This conclusion is interesting to evaluate because CMIP5 models are relied upon heavily for future temperature prediction, and are often used to develop policies.

The author of this piece is Dr. Roy Spencer, who has a Ph.D. in meteorology, and has had experience with climate-related research and jobs. These qualifications lend him credibility on the topic of climate change. However, it should be noted that Dr. Spencer has been known to minimize the presence of anthropogenic climate change, and thus this presents some bias into any views that he shares. In fact, he introduces the article with the words “As part of my Jan. 19 presentation for Friends of Science about there being no climate emergency,” indicating that he does not maintain an objective view.

This article, while using datasets and models that are fairly well known, does not include evidence for certain claims that are made. In particular, he makes reference to the views of other people with the words “There was little CO2 emitted up through the 1970s, and even as the emissions rose after the 1940s the cooling effect of anthropogenic SO2 emissions was canceling out much of that warming. This is widely agreed to by climate modelers as well.” to support his claim that anthropogenic warming can only be measured from the 1980s. However, there is no external source cited for this, making it difficult to verify the truth of his assessment. Overall, due to the bias present within this article, as well as the lack of external source referencing, provides support for this article not being a credible source of information.

Numerous studies have evaluated the CMIP5 models in comparison to observed data. An interesting conclusion that emerged from a study is that some CMIP5 models were better suited to model Southeast Asia than other models (Kamworapan and Surussavadee, 2019). Therefore, taking an average of various model simulation temperatures, as Dr. Spencer did may not be feasible as not all models may be appropriate for Canada. There does not seem to be any direct comparison of Canadian temperatures to these models, so it is difficult to speculate about the accuracy of this statement and whether any confounding factors are present. However, it should be noted that these CMIP5 models have shown accuracy; for example, 36 models showered accuracy in  in modelling global annual mean surface air temperature anomalies from 1850 to 2012 (Bush and Lemmen, 2019). In addition, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has stated that evaluating models based on the past does have important limitations, namely BLANK (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 2013). However, these limitations were not adequately considered by Dr Roy. Finally, Dr. Roy does not consider the fact that though in his analysis, the temperatures aren’t as high as predicted, temperatures in Canada are twice as high as the global average (Bush and Lemmen, 2019). This is attributed to a phenomenon called “Arctic amplification,” which describes that five mahjor positive feedbacks in the arctic amplify the effect of global warming on temperature (Bush and Lemmen, 2019). It is true, however, that some IPCC climate models do not reflect all components of atmospheric interactions, but these are likely to improve over time (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 2013).
