## **Top 5 List of Articles**
<!--Nested list with links-->
1. [Canada is Warming at Only 1/2 the Rate of Climate Model Simulations](http://www.drroyspencer.com/2021/01/canada-is-warming-at-only-1-2-the-rate-of-climate-model-simulations/ "Title")
   * This article claims that Canada is in fact only warming at half the rate of climate model simulations.
   * This seemed to create uncertainty around the accuracy of CMIP5 models, which is concerning as global warming may not be occurring to as large an extent, and the model itself may not be accurate.
2. [The Combined Impacts of Ocean Acidification and Warming on *Symbiochlorum hainanensis*](http://www.co2science.org/articles/V24/feb/a5.php "Title")
   * This article claims that observed warming trends are much less than typically shown due to the urban island effect.
   * This made me question my current views because it analyzed data to come to conclusions, and further supported their claims with knowledge about the urban heat island effect which I do not know much about.
3. [Autumn In United Kingdom, Ireland Has Not Warmed Since 1995 …Cooling Tendency](https://wattsupwiththat.com/2020/12/28/autumn-in-united-kingdom-ireland-has-not-warmed-since-1995-cooling-tendency/ "Title")
   * This article claims that a warmer Arctic does not cause cold snaps, and thus the polar vortex theory is not scientifically supported.
   * This made me question my current views because it used direct quotations from a Nature article in support of its argument.
4. [Weakened evidence for mid-latitude impacts of Arctic warming](https://wattsupwiththat.com/2021/02/10/journal-nature-refutes-piks-fantasy-rich-science-that-a-warmer-arctic-causes-extreme-cold-snaps/ "Title")
   * This article claims that fall temperatures at stations across the United Kingdom and Ireland have decreased or stayed the same since 1995.
   * This made me question my current views because it directly contradicted well-known global trends of temperature increases from the start of the Industrial Revolution.
5. [Could Recent U.S. Warming Trends be Largely Spurious?](https://wattsupwiththat.com/2021/01/30/could-recent-u-s-warming-trends-be-largely-spurious/ "Title")
   * This article claims that climate change is not having an effect on coral reefs through explaining that an increase in CO2 will benefit a certain species of coral.
   * This made me question my current views because it is generally a well stated fact that coral reefs are being destroyed by climate change, and this data seemed to be saying the opposite.  

## Common Themes
In multiple articles, a common theme was that the authors referenced a reputable external source, such as a journal article or government-released report, to substantiate their claims. More than this, they chose specific figures or text that support their position, while disregarding other data that is in opposition. The use of complex terminology or inclusion of complex concepts was also a common theme; this appeals to people’s ignorance and makes the claim more convincing.

Many of the articles also used a slippery slope argument. For example, Article 3 correctly described data suggesting that there may not be as large a correlation between Arctic ice melting and mid-latitudes, but then stated that this data disproved the polar vortex theory altogether. Another common fallacy that I observed is ad hominem, as many articles included direct insults towards other climate scientists, rather proving why the climate scientists’ arguments were wrong.

## Evaluation of *[“Canada is Warming at Only 1/2 the Rate of Climate Model Simulations”](http://www.drroyspencer.com/)*
I chose this article because it used methodology similar to scientific studies, and thus it is not immediately clear whether its claims are true or false. The author compared the observed temperatures to the temperatures predicted by climate models in Canada (Roy, 2021). From 1991-2020, the author took the average of 108 CMIP5 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, phase 5) model simulations, and compared this to CruTem5 temperature data over the same period. From the results, the author concluded that Canada has only been warming at +0.23ºC/decade, more than double the model average (Figure 1). In addition, he found that 93.5% of model simulations predicted warmer temperatures than the observed temperatures (Figure 1). This claim is interesting to evaluate because CMIP5 models are used in reports which inform climate change policies, including IPCC AR5 (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 2013).

The author of this piece is Dr. Roy Spencer. With a Ph.D. in meteorology, and experience in climate-related research, he has credibility to discuss climate change. However, he introduces the article with the words “As part of my Jan. 19 presentation for Friends of Science about there being no climate emergency,” which reveals a subjective view about climate change. He also does not include evidence for his claims, making it difficult to verify them. For example, he supports his statement that anthropogenic warming can only be measured from the 1980s using facts that are “agreed upon by other climate modelers” but does not provide evidence for this (Roy, 2021). Overall, the presence of bias, coupled with the lack of external references, makes this article an unreliable information source.

It is more difficult to ascertain the validity. Since CMIP5 is a collection of models that provide simulations of twentieth-century climate and projections for twenty-first century climate, this is valid (Taylor, Stouffer and Meehl, 2012). CRUTem5 is a land surface temperature dataset, so this is also valid (Osborn et al., 2021, p.5). Parallel to Dr. Roy’s analysis, the CMIP5 models are typically evaluated through comparison to historical observations (Bush and Lemmen, 2019). Due to this, his methodology appears plausible, but some validity concerns arise upon close examination.

Dr. Roy’s main conclusion is that climate models are predicting temperatures much higher than the observed data. A temperature overestimate of some CMIP5 models due to high anthropogenic forcing estimates has been observed, which lends some support to his conclusions (Forster et al., 2013). Other studies have determined that CMIP5 models match observed global temperature data, suggesting that there may be limitations with Dr. Roy’s analysis (Kumar et al., 2013; Koutroulis et al., 2016). For example, unlike Dr. Roy, one study used a pdf skill score, since it is a stricter measure than the average of the climate models (Koutroulis et al., 2016). In addition, reanalysis datasets are also used in model evaluation studies for greater accuracy (Sheffield et al., 2013), unlike in Dr. Roy’s study.

Dr. Roy compared the model results to observed data from 1991-2020 to reach his conclusions, which may not be fully accurate. Importantly, the models have been shown to align with the observations from 1991-2010 (Knutson, Zeng and Wittenberg, 2013). His justification is that since CO2 emissions were not significant until the 1970s and anthropogenic SO2 offset carbon emissions in the mid-twentieth century, measuring temperature trends from the 1980s would provide the best measure of anthropogenic warming. However, anthropogenic warming has been observed over a period of 1901-2010 (Knutson, Zeng and Wittenberg, 2013), indicating that CO2 emissions before 1980 should be considered. In addition, though SO2 does have a cooling effect (Liu et al., 2012), global SO2 emissions peaked in the 1970s, and then decreased slightly until 2000, not supporting Dr. Roy’s claim (Smith et al., 2011).

He does not include the raw observations or the model simulation results, so it is difficult to evaluate the data analysis directly. In addition, no studies appear to evaluate CMIP5 models for Canadian temperatures, so it is uncertain whether there are any major methodological errors. Due to this, the validity of his claims cannot be definitely determined, but the claim warrants further investigation as the previously described concerns reduce its validity.
